# drawing-pad
v 1.0

This is a simple drawing pad that allows you to draw images with a pixelated effect. You can change the amount of cells in the canvas by moving the slider to the left or the right. 

I did this by fixing the canvas size to about 500 pixels, and each time the slider is moved, a function takes the value from the slider (n) and fills in the canvas with n^2 cells. The width and height of the cell is calculated simply by taking n/500. 

# ideas for upcoming versions: 
-save pictures
-add a color wheel to choose any color 
-animate after saving several frames
